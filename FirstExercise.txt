# **How Web Works Exercise**

## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP? - HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, this controls how clients get get or send data to servers

- What is a URL? - url is the short version of Uniform Resource Locator, a URL is an address for some internet resource.

- What is DNS? - DNS is Short for Domain Name System, this is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.

- What is a query string? - The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in the format ?key1=value1&key2=value2.

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? - GET - allows you to get some data from the server while POST will send some data to the server 

- What is an HTTP request? - An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol 

- What is an HTTP response? An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen - 
- Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. 
- Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
- Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control

- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
1. Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
2. Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers 
3. The server sends a response typically, HTML.
4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed 
5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each


## **Part Two: Practice Tools**

1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*
3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***. Visit the page in a browser.

## **Part Three: Explore Dev Tools**

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

## **Part Four: Explore the URL API**

At times, it’s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly the query string).

[Read about the URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)

Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class.
